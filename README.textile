h1. EncodedAttachment

This is the bestest and certainly the easiest way to handle file uploads/downloads to Paperclip-using Active Record-backed resources using Active Resource. Rather than trying to create a multipart form submission, it just embeds the file's binary data in the Active Record model's to_xml. You can also embed binary data into XML to submit using Active Resource. These tags will automatically be parsed by Active Record and Active Resource to create files.

Adds a class method called "encode_attachment_in_xml" to Active Record that can be used alongside Paperclip's "has_attached_file" to automatically generate useful and usable binary XML tags for the attachment's original file by wrapping to_xml.

Adds a class method called "has_encoded_attachment" to Active Resource that generates a schema for the file's attributes and then embeds the file's binary content in to_xml IF the file has been changed or the record is new. (You can also force this using <pre>:include_files => true</pre>.) File accessors include file= and file_path=. MIME types are detected based on the file name.

The Active Record methods will only be included if both Active Record and Paperclip are loaded. The Active Resource methods can be used independently (i.e. in a "client" project).


h2. Example

In Active Record:

<pre>
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_attached_file        :pdf
    encode_attachment_in_xml :pdf
end

my_model = MyModel.create(:pdf => File.open('example.pdf'))
my_model.to_xml => '<my-model>\n<pdf type="file" name="example.pdf" content-type="application/pdf">[binary data]</pdf>\n</my-model>'
</pre>

In Active Resource:

<pre>
class MyModelResource < ActiveResource::Base
    self.element_name = "my_model"
    
    has_encoded_attachment :pdf
end

my_model_resource = MyModelResource.new.from_xml(my_model.to_xml)
my_model_resource.pdf # => <StringIO> containing binary data
my_model_resource.save_pdf_as("my_downloaded_file.pdf")

my_model_resource.pdf = File.open('example-downloaded.pdf')
my_model_resource.pdf_file_name # => "example_downloaded.pdf"
my_model_resource.pdf_content_type # => "application/pdf"
</pre>
