h1. EncodedAttachment

Requires Paperclip and Active Record.

This is the bestest way to handle file uploads/downloads using Active Resource. Rather than trying to create a multipart request, it just embeds the file's binary data in the downloaded XML. You can also embed binary data into XML to submit using Active Resource.

Adds a class method called "encode_attachment_in_xml" to Active Record that can be used alongside Paperclip's "has_attached_file" to automatically generate useful and usable binary XML tags for the attachment's original file by wrapping to_xml.

These tags will automatically be parsed by Active Record and Active Resource to create files. Be sure to also  set #{attachment_name}_content_type and #{attachment_name}_file_name in your Active Resource so that Paperclip handles saving the file correctly.


h2. Example

In Active Record:

<pre>
class MyModel < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_attached_file        :pdf
    encode_attachment_in_xml :pdf
end

my_model = MyModel.create(:pdf => File.open('example.pdf'))
my_model.to_xml => '<my-model>\n<pdf type="file" name="example.pdf" content-type="application/pdf">[binary data]</pdf>\n</my-model>'
</pre>

In Active Resource:

<pre>
class MyModelResource < ActiveResource::Base
    self.element_name = "my_model"
    
    has_encoded_attachment :pdf
end

my_model_resource = MyModelResource.new.from_xml(my_model.to_xml)
my_model_resource.pdf # => <StringIO> containing binary data
my_model_resource.save_pdf_as("my_downloaded_file.pdf")

my_model_resource.pdf = File.open('example-downloaded.pdf')
my_model_resource.pdf_file_name # => "example_downloaded.pdf"
my_model_resource.pdf_content_type # => "application/pdf"
</pre>
